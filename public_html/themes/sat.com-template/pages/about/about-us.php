          SAT is aimed for everyone involved in education. Literally everyone – from schools, head teachers, classroom teachers, cooks,cleaner and the lolliplady (or man).
          Yes ‘seekateacher’ is a little misleading as it is not just for teachers.

            <p class="des">SAT was created by<b>Meera Vasudeva in 2015,</b> an English teacher (who, by the way, still teaches and loves her job). I could give a dreamy account that SAT grew out of a random pub conversation and tell you the rest is history. Sorry, but it is a bit more prosaic then that. Well to begin with, it was Starbucks not a pub, and secondly, she was sober. It was Meara’s perennial incessant moaning one late Sunday afternoon, about her evaporating English department, which was thinly held together by a continuous stream of daily supply teachers. To  quote-unquote her verbatim frustration, “Wouldn’t it be great if there was a website like LinkedIn where teachers can up load their teaching profile and connect with each other”.
              Her tête-à-tête compatriot response was laconic, “do it”. So she did</p>

                  Until then, our humble attempt is to provide an on-line service to foster
                  a closer relationship between educational  rganisations and teaching and
                  non-teaching staff. So if you are a school, exam boards,
                  a publishing companies, a small tutorial company, we wanted to make it easy for you to connect with individuals working in the field of education.
                  Although SAT is a bit more than that, but we believe it is better you discover that as you muse around the website. Oh yes, we told our web-developers, that it is paramount that the website should be very easy to use—child’s play. I hope we have  achieved that.
